# Optional: For enhanced email notifications (if notification_system.py is used)
# These are NOT required for core functionality and can be omitted for high-security deployments:
# requests==2.31.0 (only needed for SMS notifications via external services)
# Note: smtplib and email modules are part of Python standard library

# HIGH-SECURITY NOTE: 
# The application works completely offline without any external network dependencies.
# Email notifications use local SMTP (no external services).
# SMS notifications are disabled by default (require external service).

# Installation command for closed network:
